React UI Buffet: A Showcase of Secure and Feature-Rich React Components

This project, React UI Buffet, demonstrates the breadth of my React skills by building a collection of essential and widely used components. Each component adheres to industry standards for clean, maintainable, and reusable code.

A Secure and Interactive Feast

React UI Buffet offers a variety of interactive components, including:

Accordions: Create collapsible sections that reveal content on click, ideal for FAQs or detailed information.

Auto-complete Search: Help users find what they need quickly with a search bar that suggests options as they type.

Sticky Scrolling: Keep important elements like navigation bars or sidebars in view even as users scroll down the page.

Dropdown Menus: Provide users with a clean and efficient way to access options from a list.

Smooth Animations: Enhance user experience with subtle and visually appealing animations for transitions and interactions.

etc... Much more coming in the future, I will keep updating on this project.

Beyond the Plate: Security and User Management

This project uses Recoil for state management, From what I observed, the industry is slowly moving from redux to recoil, so I felt this will be a good chance for me to learn recoil.

This project goes further than just implementing these components. I've focused on:

Customization: Many components allow users to configure styles and behaviors for a personalized experience.

Responsive Design: Ensuring my components adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes is crucial for a positive user experience on all devices.

Performance Optimization: I've prioritized efficient code to keep the user interface smooth and responsive.

Secure Access with NextAuth:
React UI Buffet leverages NextAuth to implement robust OAuth (Open Authorization) for secure user login and management. This ensures user privacy and allows for seamless integration with various authentication providers.
Key Features:
- 🔐 Next-auth v5 (Auth.js)
- 🚀 Next.js 14 with server actions
- 🔑 Credentials Provider
- 🌐 OAuth Provider (Social login with Google & GitHub)
- 🔒 Forgot password functionality
- ✉️ Email verification
- 📱 Two factor verification (2FA)
- 👥 User roles (Admin & User)
- 🔓 Login component (Opens in redirect or modal)
- 📝 Register component
- 🤔 Forgot password component
- ✅ Verification component
- ⚠️ Error component
- 🔘 Login button
- 🚪 Logout button
- 🚧 Role Gate
- 📈 Extending & Exploring next-auth session
- 🔄 Exploring next-auth callbacks
- 🖥️ Example with server component
- 💻 Example with client component
- 👑 Render content for admins using RoleGate component
- 🛡️ Protect API Routes for admins only
- 🔐 Protect Server Actions for admins only
- 🔔 Enable/disable two-factor auth in Settings page(for development purposes only)
- 🔄 Change user role in Settings page (for development purposes only)
Authorization and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
The project goes beyond basic login by incorporating authorization and RBAC. This allows for control over user access to different features and functionalities based on their assigned roles. This enhances security and provides a good user experience depending on permissions.

Why This Project?

React UI Buffet serves as a valuable tool for:
